# Advent Of Code

Here are my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

I am using Python for my solutions to the puzzles.

Day to day I work with C and C++.  I have been trying to pick-up Python for a while now to aid with data processing, code generation, and testing.  As most work things go, unless you have a required need for a project it is hard to pick up a new language.  But I have slowly been getting the hang of things and making in roads with work group adoption.

All that said, aside from using Python I have no particular strategy or approach that I am taking for solving these puzzles.  I am just try trying learn new techniques that I haven't had time to explore.   So far I have tackled `numpy`, `itertools`, and brushed up a bit on my `regex`.   I just discovered Advent of Code so I am a little behind the curve but get through these over the holiday break.

Hope some of my solutions are of benefit to somebody.
