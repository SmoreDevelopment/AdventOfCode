# Advent Of Code 2020

Here are my solutions to the [2020 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

I am using python.  My primary languages are c/++.  I have recently taken up learning Python recently to aid with data processing and work flow automation.  None of my solutions are particularly elegant or attempting to solve the puzzles through a particular approach.  I am trying approaches that I have never attempted before or trying to brush on approaches that I don't get to use regularly (i.e. regex).

Hope some of my solutions are of benefit to somebody.
